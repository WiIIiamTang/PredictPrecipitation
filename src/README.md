# Logistic Regression

LogisticWine classifies between two sorts of wine denoted by 0 and 1.


## Validation against other datasets

Just to see if the results we get aren't based on luck, we checked if our actual implementation of logistic regression was working by testing it against another dataset.
We used the breast cancer data as well as some school exam marks.


## Some Results

26/04/2019

***LogisticWine1:*** a varied test & training set accuracy of about 70-90% over repeated trials.

***Breast Cancer:*** consistent test & training set accuracy of about 94-97% over repeated trials.

Results actually depend on what data points are in the training set/test set. This is not normal. Refer to the issue opened with title "Gradient Descent: stopping condition and other problems"
