# Logistic Regression

**Instructions**: To run the program, compile and run MachineLearn.java. This is set by default to classify the wine dataset (dataset_wine1.txt holds label 1: wine 1 and label 0: wine 2).

Modify parameters or whatever you want in this java file. For example, in the gradient descent, you'll use the fit() method. You can change the alpha(learning rate), max num of iterations, regularization, and tolerance level for the stopping condition.

We'd recommend not changing anything in the /ai directory.


## Validation against other datasets

Just to see if the results we get aren't based on luck, we checked if our actual implementation of logistic regression was working by testing it against another dataset.
We used the breast cancer data as well as some school exam marks.

You can change what the program classifies by changing the file path in the code.

There is also a [python implementation](/python_implementation) using sklearn that we use to compare our model with a premade machine learning library.
