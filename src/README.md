# Logistic Regression

LogisticWine classifies between two sorts of wine denoted by 0 and 1.


## Validatation against other datasets

Just to see if the results we get aren't based on luck, we checked if our actual implementation of logistic regression was working by testing it against another dataset.
We used the breast cancer data as well as some school exam marks.
