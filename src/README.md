# Logistic Regression

LogisticWine classifies between two sorts of wine denoted by 0 and 1.

**Instructions**: To run the program, compile and run MachineLearn.java. This is set to classify the wine dataset.

Modify parameters or whatever as you want in this java file.
We'd recomend not changing anything in the /ai directory.


## Validation against other datasets

Just to see if the results we get aren't based on luck, we checked if our actual implementation of logistic regression was working by testing it against another dataset.
We used the breast cancer data as well as some school exam marks.

You can change what the program classifies by changing the file path in the code.

There is also a [python implementation](/python_implementation) using sklearn that we use to compare our model with other machine learning libraries.
