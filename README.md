# using logistic regression to predict precipitation on a given day

binary logistic regression to predict precipitation probability

making a machine learning model that will learn to predict possibility of precipitation on a day given some factors (Temperature, wind, snowfall, season).

# Instructions

our question asks if a linear regression model would be appropriate to model something like this in weather

If you want to change the dataset, you have to replace the dataset.txt file in src/data/dataset.txt
