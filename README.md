# using logistic regression to predict precipitation on a given day

binary logistic regression to predict precipitation probability

making a machine learning model that will learn to predict possibility of precipitation on a day given some factors (Temperature, wind, snowfall, season)

# Instructions

our question asks if a linear regression model would be appropriate to model something like this in weather
to start the program, run the PredictPrecipitation class.
If you want to change the dataset, you have to replace the dataset.txt file in src/data/dataset.txt
