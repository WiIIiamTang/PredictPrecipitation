dataset.txt is the csv file to read into the program. DO NOT CHANGE THE LOCATION NOR THE NAME OF THIS FILE.

Replace the dataset.txt by any csv file to change what the dataset is, or make your own.
Make sure the #col and #rows are good in the code - Array sizes should be changed accordingly in main class
